                If you'd like to participate officially as a Harvard College Marathon Challenge (HCMC) runner/fundraiser —
                which means you'll receive a numbered Boston Marathon bib — then please read the rest of this page and complete the Online Interest Form at the bottom.
                <i> Do keep in mind that actively participating in runs posted to <a href="http://lists.fas.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/marathon-list">our listserv </a> and actively posting to our listserv will increase your chances of getting a spot!</i>

              <p>
                As a Harvard College Marathon Challenge (HCMC) participant, you'll be one of the few lucky folks at Harvard to receive a coveted official invitational #
                charity entry for the <a href="https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon">127th Boston Marathon</a> that will occur on Monday, April 17, 2023 (which is Patriots Day, a school day at Harvard). 
                Between now and Marathon Day, you'll have many opportunities to meet and train with other HCMC participants, 
                in the process exploring vast tracts of heretofore unvisited areas around Cambridge, Boston, and other local communities (or remotely,
                if you're not on campus). In exchange for the satisfaction, camaraderie, increased wellness, and sheer pleasure you'll derive from
                this once-in-a-lifetime experience, you'll also have the privilege of raising a few bucks for a worthy cause. Since its inception in 2005-06,
                HCMC runners have raised over $850,000! In short, if you elect to participate in HCMC, you'll:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>improve your physical conditioning</li>
                <li>regularly leave the creature comforts of campus to venture forth into parts unknown</li>
                <li>raise money for a fantastic cause</li>
                <li>bask in the supreme post-achievement glory that'll envelop you when you cross the Finish Line</li>
                <li>have loads of fun along the way!</li>

                That means regularly posting runs to the listserv (or photos/run reports if you're remote), going on runs that others post if you're

                Many Harvard students volunteer with PBHA SUP. It's a great program that does wonderful things for underserved youth in the Greater Boston area!

                That'd make you a typical participant, since this is an amateur event!
                After training up to it, most of our runners run the Marathon at a pace between 7.5-11 minutes/mile. 
                But some run faster and some run slower. Preparing for a marathon is like writing a thesis, but with your body
                and your mind as joint beneficiaries of your efforts. You'll have, and you'll need, months to train physically
                and mentally for the Big Event. The good news is that you can take up to six (6) hours to complete the 26.2-mile course!
                That's the official maximum time limit, which equates to about a 13.5-minute mile. 
                Remember, this isn't a race: it's a steady, measured, disciplined event that you'll work towards over time.
                Plus, running the Boston Marathon is very different from running on your own: there are huge crowds lining the entire Marathon route —
                spectators ranging from little kids to nursing home residents — and they'll all be cheering for you and supporting you no matter how fast or slow your're going.

                Training programs abound for runners of all ability, experience, and distance levels. 
                There are training programs for totally inexperienced runners; there are training programs for recreational runners; 
                there are training programs for competitive short-distance and cross-country runners who want to try their first marathon;
                and there are training programs for veteran marathoners seeking to improve their performance. 
                You should find a training program that feels comfortable for you. 
                Here are some well-known training programs that span distances from 5K to a full marathon:

                    (run only 3 days/week, but intensely, as described in this Runner's World article and in the book <a href="http://runlessrunfaster.com/">Run Less, Run Faster</a>)

                </ul>
                If you're new to running, then you should start training for Boston before Thanksgiving. 
                If you're already a recreational runner, then plan on training for at least 4 months (16 weeks).
